# Power BI Dashboard Project for Flight Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains SQL scripts and resources for setting up a Power BI dashboard that visualizes flight data across various metrics. The dashboard aims to provide insights into flight operations, model performance, and market trends based on historical data.

## Repository Structure
- `/sql` - Contains all SQL scripts used to fetch data for the Power BI dashboard.
  - `/queries` - SQL scripts for each specific visualization component.
- `/docs` - Documentation about the project and data models.
- `/resources` - Includes data dictionaries and setup instructions.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Set up a database and import your flight data into tables structured as needed for the SQL scripts.
3. Run the SQL scripts in the `/sql/queries` directory to prepare your data.
4. Import the resulting data into Power BI and configure your dashboard according to the visualizations described.

## Usage
Use the SQL queries to fetch data tailored for visualization in Power BI. Customize your Power BI dashboard using the fields and instructions specified for each type of chart or table.
